Getting Involved
===============

---------------

* [Mailing Lists](mailing-lists.md) - Join the dev list to make sure you're coordinating with the rest of the team
* [Individual Contributor License]() - We need this to accept any code you submit
* [Git Setup and Pull Requests]() - All the basics of getting started with the repo and how we prefer to receive pull requests
* [Current Status]() - Take a look at what we're doing and then email the dev list to let us know that you're working on something
