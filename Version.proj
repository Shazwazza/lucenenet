    <!-- IMPORTANT: VersionPrefix must always be the same as the Lucene version this is based on.
      Never increment it for an individual build - only increment this when an entire version's changes
      are ported over from Lucene. This is what determines the version of all of the NuGet packages and binaries. -->
